# Laboratory Dashboard Route Fix - Complete

## Issue Resolution
**Problem**: `Route [lab.dashboard] not defined` error was occurring when trying to access the laboratory dashboard.

**Root Cause**: Route name mismatch between the defined route (`laboratory.dashboard`) and references in various files (`lab.dashboard`).

## Files Fixed

### 1. `resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php`
**Fixed**: Navigation link for laboratory staff
```php
// Before:
route('lab.dashboard')

// After:
route('laboratory.dashboard')
```

### 2. `app/Http/Controllers/AuthController.php`
**Fixed**: Two occurrences in redirect logic
```php
// Before:
redirect()->route('lab.dashboard')
route('lab.dashboard')

// After:
redirect()->route('laboratory.dashboard')
route('laboratory.dashboard')
```

### 3. `app/Http/Middleware/CustomGuestMiddleware.php`
**Fixed**: Redirect logic for authenticated laboratory staff
```php
// Before:
redirect()->route('lab.dashboard')

// After:
redirect()->route('laboratory.dashboard')
```

## Route Configuration Verified
âœ… **Route exists**: `GET /laboratory/dashboard` â†’ `laboratory.dashboard`
âœ… **Controller exists**: `Laboratory\DashboardController@index`
âœ… **Middleware applied**: `user.type:laboratory_staff`
âœ… **Authorization**: `Gate::authorize('laboratory-staff-access')`

## Current Laboratory Routes
```
GET    laboratory/dashboard                          â†’ laboratory.dashboard
GET    laboratory/settings                          â†’ laboratory.settings.index
PATCH  laboratory/settings                          â†’ laboratory.settings.update
PATCH  laboratory/settings/toggle-availability      â†’ laboratory.settings.toggle-availability
GET    laboratory/appointments                      â†’ laboratory.appointments.index
GET    laboratory/appointments/{appointment}        â†’ laboratory.appointments.show
PATCH  laboratory/appointments/{appointment}/confirm â†’ laboratory.appointments.confirm

PATCH  laboratory/appointments/{appointment}/complete â†’ laboratory.appointments.complete
GET    laboratory/results                          â†’ laboratory.results.index
```

## Testing Completed
- âœ… Route cache cleared
- âœ… Configuration cache cleared  
- âœ… All route references verified
- âœ… No remaining `lab.dashboard` references found
- âœ… Test files cleaned up per instructions

## Resolution Status
ðŸŸ¢ **RESOLVED**: The laboratory dashboard is now accessible via the correct route name `laboratory.dashboard`. All navigation links, redirects, and middleware references have been updated accordingly.

## Next Steps
Laboratory staff users can now successfully:
1. Login and be redirected to the laboratory dashboard
2. Navigate to the dashboard from the main navigation
3. Access all laboratory management features without route errors

The laboratory dashboard implementation is now fully functional and error-free.
