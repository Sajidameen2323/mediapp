# Appointment Action Buttons Refactoring - COMPLETE

## Overview
Successfully implemented conditional rendering of cancel and reschedule buttons using the Appointment model's `canBeCancelled()` and `canBeRescheduled()` methods instead of manual date calculations. Created a reusable action buttons component to ensure consistent permission checking across all appointment-related views.

## Completed Tasks

### ‚úÖ 1. Analysis of Current Implementation
- **Found**: Show page already uses model methods via controller variables
- **Found**: Reschedule controller already implements proper permission checks
- **Issue**: Index page was using manual date calculations instead of model methods

### ‚úÖ 2. Enhanced Custom Calendar Component Styling
- **File**: `resources/views/components/appointment/custom-calendar.blade.php`
- **Improvements**:
  - Modern gradient backgrounds and enhanced shadows
  - Sophisticated loading states with dual rotating rings and pulse animations
  - Better error handling with gradient backgrounds and enhanced retry buttons
  - Smooth transitions and animations throughout
  - Comprehensive responsive design and accessibility features
  - Dark mode optimizations and reduced motion support

### ‚úÖ 3. Updated Index Page Conditional Logic
- **File**: `resources/views/patient/appointments/index.blade.php`
- **Changes**:
  - Replaced manual date calculations with `$appointment->canBeRescheduled()` and `$appointment->canBeCancelled()`
  - Added disabled button states with tooltips for better UX when actions aren't available
  - Enhanced button styling with proper dark mode support and focus states
  - **Now uses reusable action buttons component**

### ‚úÖ 4. Added Safety Checks to Reschedule Page
- **File**: `resources/views/patient/appointments/reschedule.blade.php`
- **Enhancements**:
  - Conditional rendering that checks `$appointment->canBeRescheduled()` before showing the form
  - Elegant error state for appointments that cannot be rescheduled
  - Proper navigation options when reschedule is not allowed

### ‚úÖ 5. Created Reusable Action Buttons Component
- **File**: `resources/views/components/appointment/action-buttons.blade.php`
- **Features**:
  - Consistent styling and behavior across all appointment views
  - Tooltip support for disabled states
  - Flexible layout options (horizontal/vertical)
  - Multiple size options (sm/md/lg)
  - Print functionality for confirmed/completed appointments
  - Custom action support for modal triggers
  - Rating button support for completed appointments

### ‚úÖ 6. Updated Show Page with Reusable Component
- **File**: `resources/views/patient/appointments/show.blade.php`
- **Changes**:
  - Replaced manual action buttons with reusable component
  - Maintains existing modal functionality for cancel and rating
  - Uses vertical layout with medium size for sidebar placement

## Component Usage Examples

### Basic Usage (Index Page)
```blade
<x-appointment.action-buttons 
    :appointment="$appointment"
    :config="$config"
    layout="horizontal"
    size="sm" />
```

### Advanced Usage (Show Page)
```blade
<x-appointment.action-buttons 
    :appointment="$appointment"
    layout="vertical"
    size="md"
    :show-print="true"
    :show-rating="$appointment->status === 'completed' && !$appointment->rating"
    cancel-action="showCancelModal()"
    rating-action="showRatingModal()" />
```

## Component Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `appointment` | Appointment | required | The appointment model instance |
| `config` | AppointmentConfig | auto-loaded | Configuration for tooltips and rules |
| `layout` | string | 'horizontal' | Layout direction: 'horizontal' or 'vertical' |
| `size` | string | 'md' | Button size: 'sm', 'md', or 'lg' |
| `showView` | boolean | true | Whether to show the "View Details" button |
| `showPrint` | boolean | auto | Whether to show print button (auto for confirmed/completed) |
| `showRating` | boolean | auto | Whether to show rating button (auto for completed without rating) |
| `cancelAction` | string | null | Custom JavaScript action for cancel button |
| `ratingAction` | string | null | Custom JavaScript action for rating button |

## Permission Logic Implementation

### Reschedule Permission
- ‚úÖ Uses `$appointment->canBeRescheduled()` method
- ‚úÖ Shows disabled button with tooltip when not allowed
- ‚úÖ Tooltip explains time restrictions based on config

### Cancel Permission
- ‚úÖ Uses `$appointment->canBeCancelled()` method
- ‚úÖ Shows disabled button with tooltip when not allowed
- ‚úÖ Tooltip explains time restrictions based on config

### Print Permission
- ‚úÖ Available for confirmed and completed appointments
- ‚úÖ Can be customized via `showPrint` prop

### Rating Permission
- ‚úÖ Available for completed appointments without existing rating
- ‚úÖ Can be customized via `showRating` prop
