# Doctor Appointment Medical Report Access Integration - Update Complete

## Overview
Updated the doctor appointment show page to properly integrate with the new medical report access management system. The changes ensure that doctors can only view medical reports they have proper access to, either as the author or through granted access permissions.

## ‚úÖ Changes Made

### 1. Updated Doctor AppointmentController
**File**: `app/Http/Controllers/Doctor/AppointmentController.php`

**Enhanced `show()` method**:
- Added medical report access logic to respect the new access control system
- Query now includes:
  - Reports authored by the current doctor
  - Reports where the doctor has been granted active access
  - Proper expiration date checking for granted access
- Added eager loading for prescriptions and lab test requests
- Passed `$medicalReports` to the view

**Access Logic**:
```php
$medicalReports = \App\Models\MedicalReport::where('patient_id', $appointment->patient_id)
    ->where(function ($query) use ($doctor) {
        $query->where('doctor_id', $doctor->id)
            ->orWhereHas('accessRecords', function ($accessQuery) use ($doctor) {
                $accessQuery->where('doctor_id', $doctor->id)
                    ->where('status', 'active')
                    ->where(function ($expQuery) {
                        $expQuery->whereNull('expires_at')
                            ->orWhere('expires_at', '>', now());
                    });
            });
    })
    ->with(['doctor.user', 'prescriptions', 'labTestRequests'])
    ->orderBy('consultation_date', 'desc')
    ->get();
```

### 2. Updated Doctor Appointment Show View
**File**: `resources/views/doctor/appointments/show.blade.php`

**Removed Direct Database Query**:
- Eliminated the `@php` block that was directly querying medical reports
- Now uses the `$medicalReports` variable provided by the controller

**Enhanced Medical Report Display**:
- **Access Type Indicators**: Shows "Shared Access" badge for reports where doctor has granted access
- **Status Badges**: Color-coded status indicators (completed/draft)
- **Author Information**: Displays the original report author

- **Prescription/Lab Test Summary**: Displays count and preview of prescriptions and lab tests
- **Conditional Edit Access**: Only shows edit button for reports authored by the current doctor
- **Read-Only Indicator**: Shows "Read Only" badge for shared access reports

**UI Improvements**:
- Better visual hierarchy with icons and badges
- Responsive design following THEME.md guidelines
- Dark mode support with proper color schemes
- FontAwesome icons throughout
- Improved spacing and layout
