# Appointment Calendar Redesign - Complete

## Summary

Successfully redesigned and modernized the custom calendar and datetime selection components for the MediCare appointment booking system. The new system addresses all the original issues with selectable dates visibility and disabled date functionality.

## Issues Addressed

### Original Problems
1. **Poor Visual Feedback**: Selectable and disabled dates were not clearly distinguished
2. **Fragmented Code**: Calendar logic was spread across multiple files with poor organization
3. **Complex API Integration**: Inconsistent endpoints and confusing data flow
4. **JavaScript Errors**: Multiple initialization and event handling issues
5. **Styling Issues**: Inconsistent visual design and poor responsive behavior
6. **User Experience**: Confusing interface with no clear indication of available slots

### Solutions Implemented
