# Appointment Booking Integration - COMPLETED

## Summary of Implementation

The appointment booking flow has been successfully enhanced with the following completed features:

### ✅ 1. Fixed Stepper Navigation
- **Progress Stepper Component**: Updated `progress-stepper.blade.php` with proper CSS classes (`progress-stepper`, `step`, `step-circle`, etc.) that JavaScript can target

  - Step circle states (active, completed, inactive)
  - Step labels (colors and text)
  - Connector lines between steps
  - Navigation buttons (next, back, submit)

### ✅ 2. Custom Calendar Integration

## Key Integration Points

### Calendar ↔ Main Booking Flow
```javascript
// Calendar initialized with callbacks
this.calendar = new CustomCalendar({
    onDateSelect: (dateString, dateData) => {
        this.handleDateSelection(dateString, dateData);
    }
});

// Doctor/Service changes update calendar
selectDoctor(doctor) {
    this.calendar.setDoctor(doctor.id);
}

selectService(service) {
    this.calendar.setService(service.id);
}
```

### Date Selection → Time Slot Loading
```javascript
handleDateSelection(dateString, dateData) {
    this.selectedData.date = dateString;
    document.getElementById('appointment_date').value = dateString;
    this.loadTimeSlots(dateString);
}
```

### Backend Data Flow
```
Doctor + Service Selection → Calendar API Call → Available Dates Display
Date Selection → Time Slots API Call → Available Times Display
```
