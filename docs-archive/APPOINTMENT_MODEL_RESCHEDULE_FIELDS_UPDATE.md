# APPOINTMENT MODEL RESCHEDULE FIELDS UPDATE

## 🎯 Issue Summary
The Appointment model was missing reschedule-related fields in the `$fillable` array, preventing mass assignment of these fields during appointment rescheduling operations.

## ✅ Changes Applied

### 1. Updated `$fillable` Array
Added the following reschedule-related fields based on the migration `2025_06_01_142500_add_rescheduling_fields_to_appointments_table.php`:

- `rescheduled_at` - Timestamp when the appointment was rescheduled
- `rescheduled_by` - Who rescheduled the appointment (doctor, patient, admin)  
- `reschedule_reason` - Reason for rescheduling
- `original_date` - Original appointment date before rescheduling
- `original_time` - Original appointment time before rescheduling

### 2. Updated `$casts` Array
Added proper casting for the new fields:

- `rescheduled_at` => `'datetime'`
- `original_date` => `'date'` 
- `original_time` => `'datetime:H:i'`

### 3. Fixed Timezone Calculation Issues
- Uncommented `$appointmentDateTime->setTimezone($configTimezone)` in both `canBeCancelled()` and `canBeRescheduled()` methods
- Fixed incorrect `true` parameter in `diffInHours()` method (changed to `false`)

## 📁 Files Modified

**`app/Models/Appointment.php`**
- Added 5 reschedule fields to `$fillable` array
- Added 3 reschedule fields to `$casts` array  
- Fixed timezone calculation methods

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Before Fix:
```php
protected $fillable = [
    // ... existing fields ...
    'rescheduled_from',
    'completed_at',
    'completion_notes',
];

protected $casts = [
    // ... existing casts ...
    'cancelled_at' => 'datetime',
    'completed_at' => 'datetime',
];
```

### After Fix:
```php
protected $fillable = [
    // ... existing fields ...
    'rescheduled_from',
    'rescheduled_at',        // ✅ NEW
    'rescheduled_by',        // ✅ NEW
    'reschedule_reason',     // ✅ NEW
    'original_date',         // ✅ NEW
    'original_time',         // ✅ NEW

    'completion_notes',
];

protected $casts = [
    // ... existing casts ...
    'cancelled_at' => 'datetime',
    'rescheduled_at' => 'datetime',      // ✅ NEW
    'original_date' => 'date',           // ✅ NEW
    'original_time' => 'datetime:H:i',   // ✅ NEW
    'completed_at' => 'datetime',
];
