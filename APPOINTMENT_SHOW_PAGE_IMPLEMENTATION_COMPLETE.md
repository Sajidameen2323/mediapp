# Patient Appointment Show Page Implementation - COMPLETED

## Summary

Successfully implemented comprehensive validation and modern UI design for the patient appointment show page with the following key accomplishments:

## âœ… Fixed Critical Issues

### 1. User Model Profile Method Fix

  - Laboratory: Returns laboratory profile data  
  - Pharmacy: Returns pharmacy profile data
  - Patient: Returns health profile data
  - Default: Returns empty array

- Extended existing `AppointmentRequest` class to handle show page actions
- Added conditional validation for:
  - **Cancellation requests** (PATCH method): Validates cancellation reason, ownership, and policy compliance

- Implemented comprehensive business logic validation in `withValidator()` method
