# Pharmacy Orders Filtering Fix - Implementation Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Cancelled Orders Visibility
- **Problem**: Cancelled pharmacy orders were being displayed alongside active orders, cluttering the interface
- **Solution**: Modified default behavior to exclude cancelled orders from the main listing

### 2. Filtering Logic Problems
- **Problem**: Status filtering was not working properly due to conflicting query conditions
- **Solution**: Simplified and corrected the filtering logic in the controller

## Changes Made

### Controller Changes (`app/Http/Controllers/Patient/PharmacyOrderController.php`)

1. **Fixed Default Filtering Logic**:
   ```php
   // By default, exclude cancelled orders
   if ($request->filled('status')) {
       $query->where('status', $request->status);
   } else {
       $query->where('status', '!=', 'cancelled');
   }
   ```

2. **Enhanced Search Functionality**:
   - Added pharmacy name search capability
   - Improved search to include both order number and pharmacy name

3. **Fixed Pagination**:
   - Added `$orders->appends($request->query())` to preserve filters in pagination

### Dashboard Controller Changes (`app/Http/Controllers/DashboardController.php`)

1. **Updated Statistics**:
   ```php
   'totalPharmacyOrders' => $user->pharmacyOrders()->where('status', '!=', 'cancelled')->count(),
   'pendingPaymentOrders' => $user->pharmacyOrders()->where('payment_status', 'pending')->where('status', '!=', 'cancelled')->count(),
   ```

### View Changes (`resources/views/dashboard/patient/pharmacy-orders/index.blade.php`)

1. **Improved Filter Interface**:
   - Changed "All Statuses" to "Active Orders" to clarify default behavior
   - Added "Cancelled Only" option for viewing cancelled orders specifically

2. **Added Information Banner**:
   - Displays info when showing active orders with link to view cancelled orders
   - Provides clear feedback about what orders are being shown

3. **Enhanced Empty States**:
   - Different messages based on filter context
   - Clear indication when no orders match criteria
   - Option to view cancelled orders from empty state

4. **Improved Search Placeholder**:
   - Changed from "Order number..." to "Order number or pharmacy..." to reflect enhanced search

## User Experience Improvements

### 1. Clear Communication
- Users are informed when cancelled orders are hidden
- Easy access to view cancelled orders when needed
- Contextual empty state messages

### 2. Better Navigation
- Info banner with quick link to toggle between active and cancelled orders
- Improved filter labels for clarity

### 3. Enhanced Search
- Can now search by both order number and pharmacy name
- More intuitive search experience

## Technical Benefits

### 1. Cleaner Interface
- Reduced visual clutter by hiding cancelled orders by default
- Better focus on actionable orders

### 2. Improved Performance
- Reduced data load by excluding cancelled orders from default queries
- Better pagination performance with preserved filter state

### 3. Better Filtering Logic
- Simplified and more reliable filtering implementation
- Proper handling of edge cases

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Default Behavior**:
   - Verify cancelled orders are hidden by default
   - Confirm active orders display correctly

2. **Test Filtering**:
   - Test each status filter individually
   - Test payment status filtering
   - Test combined filters

3. **Test Search**:
   - Search by order number
   - Search by pharmacy name
   - Test partial matches

4. **Test Navigation**:
   - Test pagination with filters applied
   - Test links between active and cancelled views
   - Test filter reset functionality

## Migration Notes

- No database changes required
- Existing data remains unchanged
- Backwards compatible implementation
- No breaking changes to API or routes

## Future Enhancements

1. Consider adding filter presets (e.g., "Recent Orders", "Ready for Pickup")
2. Add date range filtering
3. Consider adding bulk actions for multiple orders
4. Add export functionality for order history
