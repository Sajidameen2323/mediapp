     - `test-scripts/test_user_profile.php` (restored as placeholder)  
     - `test-scripts/timezone_fix_summary.php` (restored as placeholder)

3. **Temporary Route Files**
   - `routes/doctor_search_snippet.php` - Empty file, removed

### Files Kept (Production Ready)
1. **Database Migrations** (All rating system migrations kept as they're production ready)
   - `2025_06_11_151616_add_rating_fields_to_appointments_table.php`
